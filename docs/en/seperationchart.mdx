# Seperation Chart

The seperation chart demo shows you how to build the graph by popular **state-driven**.  

## State-Driven Chart

Example of a seperation chart.

When we hover the color chunk, the state will be changed, the index of active chunk will be set.  
The text and color of label will be update later in the **`update: (timestamp: number) => void`** callback.
The state in this example is `state = { active = -1, x = 0, y = 0 }`, the active means currently active chunk index.  

You can build this state-driven example in just 154 lines of code, styles and mock data included,   
that's the title `build your own xxx in 100 lines of code and 20 minutes`, maintainable, productive and practical so that you can build more features.
